Explain usage of service locator, and why it's bad.

Explain how service locator and incorrect instance (singleton) was being resolved in ServerMessageSessionInspector, leading to single instance of Datacontext that did not get updated data from DB!

Explain that each layer should not trust the other.

Business logic should validate every scenario, such as the dupliate dates check in TimesheetManager.GetCapturedTime

Segregation of work, full stack developers don't focus enough on one task, forget smaller detail about one task.

Unit testing and refactoring:  TimesheetManager.GetCapturedTime, see other attached doc
